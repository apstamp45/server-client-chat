## Server Client Chat

<p>&nbsp &nbsp This program allows text to be sent between a server and client over LAN. To use it, first launch the server, then launch the client with the server's IPv4, and the port number (if it specified when launching the server). To close a connection, enter "END" on either end (server or client). The default IPv4 is 127.0.0.1 (localhost), and the default port is 48128.</p>
