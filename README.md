## Server Client Chat

<p>&nbsp &nbsp This program connects a server and client, and lets them send text to each other over LAN. To use it, first launch the server, then launch the client with the server's IPv4, and port number (if it specified when launching the server). To close a connection, enter "END" on either end (server or client). Default IPv4 is 127.0.0.1 (localhost), and the default port is 48128.</p>
